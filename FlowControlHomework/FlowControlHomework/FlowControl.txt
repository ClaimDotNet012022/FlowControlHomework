HW assigment passes all tests!
added to line 36; reassigned changeFlow3 to false .
fixed line 37; now it is back to (changeFlow3 == false).
added to line 354;  changed the max2 from 17 to 16 so that it passes the test.
changed back for (int i = 16; i <= max2; i++) to its previous state and assigned i = 16.
fixed line 367; now Assert.IsTrue(false) instead of true.
